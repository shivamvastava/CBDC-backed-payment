# CBDC-backed Payment System

A comprehensive Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) payment system built on Ethereum with integrated AML compliance, token conversion capabilities, and automated pool management.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system consists of core smart contracts that implement the CBDC transaction flow shown in the system diagram:

### Core Contracts

- **WINR Token** (`contracts/WINR.sol`): ERC20 token representing Wrapped Indian Rupee with built-in compliance features
- **SimpleAMLHook** (`contracts/SimpleAMLHook.sol`): AML compliance checking with blacklist management  
- **TokenConversionService** (`contracts/TokenConversionService.sol`): Multi-token conversion to wINR with daily limits
- **SimplePoolFactory** (`contracts/SimplePoolFactory.sol`): Automated pool creation and management

### V4 Integration Contracts (Advanced)

- **AMLSwapHook** (Uniswap V4): Advanced AML hook with real-time swap intervention
- **PoolFactory** (Uniswap V4): Full Uniswap V4 pool factory with integrated compliance

## ✨ Features

### 🔒 Regulatory Compliance
- **Real-time AML Checks**: Automatic blacklist verification for all participants
- **Regulatory Pause**: Emergency pause mechanisms for compliance requirements
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive event logging for regulatory reporting
- **Owner Controls**: Multi-level access control for administrative functions

### 💱 Token Conversion
- **Multi-Token Support**: Convert various tokens to wINR
- **Rate Management**: Configurable conversion rates with owner controls
- **Daily Limits**: Per-user daily conversion limits to prevent abuse
- **Min/Max Controls**: Transaction size limits for risk management

### 🏊 Pool Management
- **Automated Creation**: Simple pool creation with integrated AML hooks
- **Pool Enumeration**: Track and manage all created pools
- **Emergency Controls**: Pool deactivation and pause capabilities

### 🛡️ Security Features
- **OpenZeppelin v5**: Latest security standards and patterns
- **ReentrancyGuard**: Protection against reentrancy attacks
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for sensitive operations
- **Emergency Functions**: Safe withdrawal and recovery mechanisms

## 📊 System Status

### ✅ Production Ready Components
- **WINR Token**: Fully tested ERC20 with compliance features (16 tests, 90% coverage)

## 🚚 Deployment

### Local Deployment

```bash
# Set up environment
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Deploy to local network
make deploy-local

# Or using forge directly
forge script script/SimpleDeploy.s.sol --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 --broadcast
```

### Testnet Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to Sepolia
PRIVATE_KEY=your_key forge script script/SimpleDeploy.s.sol \
  --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL \
  --broadcast \
  --verify
```

## 📋 Transaction Flow

The system implements the complete CBDC transaction flow:

1. **User Initiation**: User initiates wINR transaction
2. **AML Check**: Real-time blacklist verification  
3. **Token Conversion**: Automatic conversion of non-wINR tokens
4. **Pool Management**: Automated liquidity pool operations
5. **Compliance Tracking**: Full audit trail and reporting
6. **Settlement**: Final transaction settlement with regulatory compliance

## 🔧 Configuration

### Token Conversion Setup

```solidity
// Authorize a token for conversion
conversionService.updateAuthorizedToken(tokenAddress, true);

// Set conversion rate (1:1 example)
conversionService.updateConversionRate(tokenAddress, 1e18);

// Set daily limits
conversionService.setDailyConversionLimit(userAddress, tokenAddress, dailyLimit);
```

### AML Configuration

```solidity
// Add address to blacklist
amlHook.updateBlacklist(suspiciousAddress, true);

// Remove from blacklist
amlHook.updateBlacklist(addressToUnblock, false);
```

## 🏆 Gas Optimization

The contracts are optimized for gas efficiency:

- **WINR Token Deployment**: 1,092,379 gas
- **Simple AML Hook**: 435,838 gas  
- **Typical Transfer**: ~57,448 gas
- **AML Check**: ~38,482 gas
- **Pool Creation**: ~111,532 gas

## 🛠️ Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run specific test suites
forge test --match-contract SimpleIntegrationTest
forge test --match-contract WINRTest
forge test --match-contract TokenConversionServiceTest

# Run with different verbosity
forge test -v    # basic
forge test -vv   # medium  
forge test -vvv  # high
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Format code
forge fmt

# Run linting
forge fmt --check

# Static analysis (requires slither)
slither .
```
